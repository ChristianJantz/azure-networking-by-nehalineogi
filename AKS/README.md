## Overview Docker, Kubernetes, and AKS

### Docker
- **Purpose**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Containerization**: Packages applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.
  - **Docker Engine**: The runtime that manages and runs containers.
  - **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for individual developers and small teams to build, test, and deploy applications in isolated environments.

### Kubernetes
- **Purpose**: An open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Orchestration**: Manages containerized applications across a cluster of nodes, handling scheduling, scaling, and maintenance.
  - **Components**: Includes a master node (control plane) and worker nodes, with components like kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, and kubelet.
  - **Features**: Provides load balancing, self-healing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for managing large-scale, distributed applications requiring high availability and scalability.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Purpose**: A managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Managed Service**: Azure handles the Kubernetes control plane, including updates, patching, and scaling.
  - **Integration with Azure**: Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services like Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure DevOps.
  - **Networking**: Offers networking options like Kubenet and Azure CNI for integrating Kubernetes pods with Azure Virtual Network (VNet).
  - **Security**: Provides built-in security features like Azure Policy, Azure Security Center, and integration with Azure Active Directory for RBAC.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for organizations looking to leverage Kubernetes for container orchestration while offloading the operational overhead to Azure.

### Key Differences
- **Docker**: Focuses on containerization, providing tools to create, deploy, and run containers.
- **Kubernetes**: Provides orchestration for containerized applications, managing deployment, scaling, and operations across clusters.
- **AKS**: A managed Kubernetes service on Azure, offering Kubernetes orchestration with integrated Azure services and reduced operational overhead.
